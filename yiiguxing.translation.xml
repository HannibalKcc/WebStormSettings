      <item value="!usrbinenv python Hi There! You may be wondering what this giant blob of binary data here is, you might even be worried that we're up to something nefarious (good for you for being paranoid!). This is a base85 encoding of a zip file, this zip file contains an entire copy of pip (version 21.3.1). Pip is a thing that installs packages, pip itself is a package that someone might want to install, especially if they're looking to run this get-pip.py script. Pip has a lot of code to deal with the security of installing packages, various edge cases on various platforms, and other such sort of &quot;tribal knowledge&quot; that has been encoded in its code base. Because of this we basically include an entire copy of pip inside this blob. We do this because the alternatives are attempt to implement a &quot;minipip&quot; that probably doesn't do things correctly and has weird edge cases, or compress pip itself down into a single file. If you're wondering how this is created, it is generated using `scriptsgenerate.py` in https:github.compypaget-pip." />
